The agent provided a relevant high-level action plan covering key stages, but lacked concrete configurations, examples, or implementation details, making the resolution only moderately complete."

      "reasoning": "The user asked to set up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying microservices to Kubernetes. The assistant response only provides a brief, high-level action plan with six generic steps and no concrete implementation details (e.g., sample GitHub Actions workflows, Dockerfile examples, Kubernetes manifests, or CD configuration). This makes the output insufficient and not directly usable for the stated goal. There are no safety, privacy, or procedural violations, but the lack of actionable setup details constitutes a material failure to achieve the user\u2019s objective."
