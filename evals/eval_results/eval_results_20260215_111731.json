The assistant response only provided a high-level intent and a generic action plan, without performing any analysis, describing the data, building or specifying a model in actionable detail, or providing code, results, or a justified partial output with clarifying questions. This makes the output unusable for the stated objective and represents a materially incomplete delivery relative to the request. There are no safety or tool-use issues, but the core goal was not achieved."
